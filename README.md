# My first ever blog (shresgav.netlify.app)

I made this website! Building the website was simple enough. At University of Michigan I learned how to write back end with Flask, so I decided to expand my repertoire and give Django a try. Comparing the two, I prefer Django over Flask for a few reasons. The ready-to-use admin framework really sped up development for this website, and django-summernote is the perfect little addon for blogs like this as well. 

Figuring out how to get this blog onto the World Wide Web was a bit of a hassle. I was finding AWS pretty challenging so I decided to go with Netlify + Heroku. However, it took me many painstaking hours of fiddling with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and reading documentation to come to that conclusion. Can't say I didn't learn anything though!

I still want to add more interesting projects to this site. While the todo app taught me some about React and Django, it isn't particularly exciting or impressive! I also want to set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store static images and connect that to Django.

But for now I'm happy with what I've accomplished, and I'm ready to start hunkering down and preparing for technical interviews hardcore. Be ready to see a lot Leetcode solutions out of me from here on out.
